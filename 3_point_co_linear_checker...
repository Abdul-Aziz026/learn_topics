giver 3 point f(x1, y1), s(x2, y2) && t(x3, y3)
check given 3 points is co_linear or not...
if three points is co_linear then below equation is true...

slope m = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2) = (x2-x3)/(y2-y3) = (x1-x3)/(y1-y3)

so, check only,  (x1-x2)*(y1-y3) == (y1-y2) * (x1-x3)......(i)
if equation (i) is true then f, s, t points are co_linear...
